abstract = "Let G be a graph whose edges are labeled by positive integers. Label each vertex with an integer and suppose if two vertices are joined by an edge, the vertex labels are congruent to each other modulo the edge label. The set of vertex labels satisfying this condition is called a generalized spline. Gilbert, Polster, and Tymoczko recently defined generalized splines based on work on polynomial splines by Billera, Rose, Haas, Goresky-Kottwitz-Machperson, and many others. We focus on generalized splines on n-cycles. We construct a particularly nice basis for the module of splines on n-cycles. As an application, we construct generalized splines on star graphs, wheel graphs, and complete graphs."
