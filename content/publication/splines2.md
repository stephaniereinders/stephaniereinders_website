abstract = "An integer generalized spline is a set of vertex labels on an edge-labeled graph that satisfy the condition that if two vertices are joined by an edge, the vertex labels are congruent modulo the edge label. Foundational work on these objects comes from Gilbert, Polster, and Tymoczko, who generalize ideas from geometry/topology (equivariant cohomology rings) and algebra (algebraic splines) to develop the notion of generalized splines. Gilbert, Polster, and Tymoczko prove that the ring of splines on a graph can be decomposed in terms of splines on its subgraphs (in particular, on trees and cycles), and then fully analyze splines on trees. Following Handschy-Melnick-Reinders and Rose, we analyze splines on cycles, in our case integer generalized splines. The primary goal of this paper is to establish two new bases for the module of integer generalized splines on cycles: the triangulation basis and the King basis. Unlike bases in previous work, we are able to characterize each basis element completely in terms of the edge labels of the underlying cycle. As an application we explicitly construct the multiplication table for the ring of integer generalized splines in terms of the King basis."
