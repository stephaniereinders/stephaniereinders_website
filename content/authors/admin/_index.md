I am a Ph.D. candidate at Iowa State University co-majoring in applied mathematics and computer engineering and minoring in statistics. I have worked for the [Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence](https://forensicstats.org) as a graduate research assistant since 2016, conducting research in steganalysis and camera device identification. Steganalysis seeks to identify data hidden within digital images. The goal of camera device identification is to determine which camera took a particular digital image. In my reasearch, I apply machine learning techniques and statistical models to these problems to make current techniques more efficient in practice and more suitable for presentation as evidence in court.
