I recently completed my PhD at Iowa State University in applied mathematics and computer engineering and minoring in statistics. While at Iowa State, I worked for the [Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence](https://forensicstats.org) as a graduate research assistant. In my reasearch, I applied machine learning techniques and statistical methods to digital image forensic problems to make techniques more efficient in practice and more suitable for presentation as evidence in court.
